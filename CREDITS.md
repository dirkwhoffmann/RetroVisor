## Code Inspiration
  RetroVisor was inspired by the open-source project [ShaderGlass](https://github.com/mausimus/ShaderGlass), which pioneered the concept of applying CRT shader overlays on Windows. While RetroVisor is an independent implementation, ShaderGlass served as a conceptual and inspirational starting point.
